Graph-theoretic analysis of 30 PSEi stocks using MST and correlation networks.

# PSEi Graph Analysis

This project analyzes the connectivity of 30 PSEi stocks using graph-theoretic methods.  
It includes:

- Daily log returns computation
- Threshold networks at τ=0.3, 0.4, 0.5
- Minimum spanning tree (MST) analysis
- Network visualization with sector coloring

## Requirements
- Python 3.10+
- pandas, numpy, networkx, matplotlib, yfinance

## Usage
Run the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter. The notebook automatically downloads PSEi stock prices using yfinance.
