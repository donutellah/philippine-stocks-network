## Overview

This project applies **graph theory and network analysis** to the 30 component stocks of the Philippine Stock Exchange Index (PSEi) using daily closing prices from **2023 to 2025**.

We model the stock market as a weighted undirected graph where:
- Each **node** is a PSEi stock
- Each **edge** represents a strong correlation between two stocks
- **Edge weights** are derived from a Pearson correlation-based distance metric

We then analyze the network's structure to identify **hub stocks**, **fragile connections**, and **systemic risk** — answering the question: *if a key stock collapses, how much of the market collapses with it?*

## ⚙️ How to Run

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/graph-gang-bsu/psei-graph-analysis.git
cd psei-graph-analysis
```

### 2. Set up a virtual environment (recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the notebooks in order

Open Jupyter and run the notebooks inside `/notebooks/` **in numbered order** (01 → 06). Each notebook builds on the outputs of the previous one.

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Or run the full pipeline as a script:

```bash
python src/main.py
```

## Methodology Summary

### Step 1 — Log Returns
Daily log returns are computed as:

```
r_i(t) = ln(P_i(t)) - ln(P_i(t-1))
```

### Step 2 — Pearson Correlation Matrix
A 30×30 correlation matrix is computed from the log return series of all PSEi stocks.

### Step 3 — Distance Metric
Correlations are transformed into distances:

```
d_ij = sqrt(2 * (1 - |rho_ij|))
```

Smaller distance = stronger connection between stocks.

### Step 4 — Threshold Filtering
Edges with distance > **τ = 1.2** are removed. Only strong connections survive.

### Step 5 — Graph Construction
Two filtered graph representations are built:
- **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** — keeps the N−1 strongest backbone connections
- **3-Nearest Neighbor Graph (KNN)** — each stock connects to its 3 closest neighbors

### Step 6 — Network Analysis
- **Algebraic connectivity (λ₂)** — global stability score of the network
- **Degree, betweenness, eigenvector centrality** — identifies hub stocks
- **Louvain community detection** — finds natural stock clusters

### Step 7 — Hub Removal Experiment
ALI, SMPH, and URC (the top betweenness hubs) are removed from the network.
Connected components increase from **14 → 17**, confirming structural fragility.

## 📁 Data Source

Stock price data was scraped from **PSE Edge** (https://edge.pse.com.ph)
using **Python** and **BeautifulSoup4**.

Daily closing prices for all 30 PSEi component stocks were collected
from **January 2023 to December 2025**.

The scraper script is located at `src/scraper.py`.
Raw data is saved to `data/raw/psei_closing_prices.csv`.

PSEi component tickers used:
```
AC, AEV, AGI, ALI, BDO, BPI, CBC, DMC, GLO, ICT,
JFC, JGS, LOTO, MBT, MER, SCC, SMC, SM, SMPH, ACEN,
LTG, TEL, URC, PGOLD, EMI, GTCAP, CNPF, AREIT, CNVRG, MONDE
```
